FFMPEG_simple_video
Hey there, thank you for using my simple video automation tool using FFMPEG. 
To be able to successfully use this tool, download and extract ffmpeg into you device, using the terminal. After you finish you are ready to use this script.

Create a new folder and name it whatever you like. Inside this folder place the script videos.sh . Afterwards, create two more folders within the same folder. Name one of them "images" and the other "audio_tracks". In these folders, place and even amount of images and an even amount of audio_tracks. Make sure the images are either JPEG/JPG/PNG and the audio files are ONLY mp3. After this go to your terminal, cd to the folder that contains everything you just created, and compile/run videos.sh . This should generate an output folder within the same folder that will contain your mp4s generated from joining a image/mp3 together. It will take about a minute per video- super fast exporting time by far!

Hope this helped, stay blessed.
